The solution lies in understanding CSS specificity.  Avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary, as it can make your CSS hard to maintain.

One possible solution is to restructure the CSS to remove the conflict. If the styling must cascade in a certain way, then it's ok to use `!important`. But, in general, refactor your code. 

Here's a refactored CSS that addresses the issue, this is an example only, you might need more complex restructuring:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green; /* No need for !important */
}

.child {
  color: red; /* No need for !important */
}
```

Here, specificity is removed, and `!important` is unnecessary.
